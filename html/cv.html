<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
<p><strong>Type Inferencer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Implemented a constraint-based inference algorithm in ML for the Hindley-Milner type system, which represents the current best practice for flexible static typing.</li>
<li>Implemented type systems language features including polymorphism.</li>
<li>Translated formal type-system rules into code, and added new primitives to a new language, nano-ML.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Universal Machine</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Developed an emulator in C that interprets UM instructions</li>
<li>Wrote code to interpret instructions in <em>big-endian</em> format: 32-bit codeword with
4-bit opcode and 3-registers identified with 2 bits.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PPM Image Compressor and Decompressor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wrote a program in C that takes a PPM image and compresses the image by transforming color spaces and discarding information not easily seen by the human eye (this is lossy compression).</li>
<li>Wrote conversions between different representations of color image data: first a bijection between RGB
and component video (Y/PR/PB) color spaces and then a discrete cosine transform</li>
<li>Packed and unpacked binary data that puts multiple small values (both signed and unsigned) into a word.</li>
<li>Implemented two’s-complement representations of signed data alongside floating-point arithmetic.</li>
