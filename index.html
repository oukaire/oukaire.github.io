            <h2>About</h2>
            <div class="content">
              <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
              <p>I was born in Abuja, Nigeria where I completed most of my early schooling. I graduated from <a href="http://www.fgasuleja.com.ng">Federal Government Academy</a> in 2012 and <a href="http://www.africanleadershipacademy.org">African Leadership Academy</a> in 2014.</p>
              <h3 id="abridged-autobiography">Abridged Autobiography</h3>
              <p>Coming from a humble background, Ukay is thankful to have been exposed to a wealth of experiences that makes him demonstrate servant leadership. He acknowledges that despite his hard-work and pursuit, his personal journey would have not been possible without help from many teachers, tutors and friends. He brings energy to a team, as he is a fun conversationalist, facilitator and pace-setter.</p>
              <h3 id="favorite-sports-and-teams">Favorite Sports and Teams</h3>
              <p><a href="https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/">FIFA world cup Russia 2018</a>, go Belgium!</p>
              <p>With gleeful gusto, I root for FC Barcelona. Talk about Carles Puyol, Ronaldinho, Deco or any player on the 2005 ticki tacka squad, and we'd have a nostalgic laugh.</p>
              <p>Thanks to Tufts and living in Boston area for four years, I support the <a href="https://www.patriots.com">New England Patriots</a> as well as <a href="https://www.nba.com/celtics/">Boston Celtics</a>. I seldom follow tennis and golf : go Roger Federer, go Roy Mcllroy!</p>
              <h3 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h3>
              <p>I play football at least once every week and table-tennis once every other week. Outside sports, I'm a dance enthusiast. My favorite piece was improvised; it was one winter when, in a particularly stressful week during sophomore year, Tufts permitted a snow day. How happy I was to climb my side stool, rotate my hips and do a head swivel, only to realise five minutes later that there was no music.</p>
              <p>I have a 30-minute daily routine of stepping out of my comfort zone to learn something new; that's how I fell in love with <a href="https://aeon.co">Aeon</a>. I love playing video games when I have loads of free time - rarely. I do not often read literary books, but I enjoy reading scientific papers, technical journals, and periodicals to remain current.</p>
