From friendly feedbacks, I learned to share stories of myself. Here I share more of a miniature story, not to ruin a book I hope to write.

### But first: Updates
(for avid Game of Thrones fans): Check on my [Predictions on Game of Thrones Season Eight](https://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?%2Ftopic%2F153705-predictions-on-game-of-thrones-season-eight%2F&tab=comments&fbclid=IwAR3HC4YsQSflfkDV61zVIAbkto03-u53S2wJab9TmAX_ssSzqzGt9mpEOWI#comment-8328996)

### Background
I was born in Abuja, Nigeria where I completed most of my early schooling. I graduated from [Federal Government Academy](http://www.fgasuleja.com.ng) in 2012 and [African Leadership Academy](http://www.africanleadershipacademy.org) in 2014.

### Abridged Autobiography
Coming from a humble background, Ukay is thankful to have been exposed to a wealth of experiences that makes him demonstrate servant leadership. He acknowledges that despite his hard-work and pursuit, his personal journey would have not been possible without help from many teachers, tutors and friends. He brings energy to a team, as he is a fun conversationalist, facilitator and pace-setter.

### Favorite Sports and Teams
[FIFA world cup Russia 2018](https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/), go Belgium!

With gleeful gusto, I root for FC Barcelona. Talk about Carles Puyol, Ronaldinho, Deco or any player on the 2005 ticki tacka squad, and we'd have a nostalgic laugh.

Thanks to Tufts and living in Boston area for four years, I support the [New England Patriots](https://www.patriots.com) as well as [Boston Celtics](https://www.nba.com/celtics/). I seldom follow tennis and golf : go Roger Federer, go Roy Mcllroy!

### Hobbies
I play football at least once every week and table-tennis once every other week. Outside sports, I'm a dance enthusiast. My favorite piece was improvised; it was one winter when, in a particularly stressful week during sophomore year, Tufts permitted a snow day. How happy I was to climb my side stool, rotate my hips and do a head swivel, only to realise five minutes later that there was no music.

I have a 30-minute daily routine of stepping out of my comfort zone to learn something new; that's how I fell in love with [Aeon](https://aeon.co). I love playing video games when I have loads of free time - rarely. I do not often read literary books, but I enjoy reading scientific papers, technical journals, and periodicals to remain current.
