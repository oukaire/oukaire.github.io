### Projects

**Type Inferencer**
* Implemented a constraint-based inference algorithm in ML for the Hindley-Milner type system, which represents the current best practice for flexible static typing.
* Implemented type systems language features including polymorphism.
* Translated formal type-system rules into code, and added new primitives to a new language, nano-ML.

**Universal Machine**
* Developed an emulator in C that interprets UM instructions
* Wrote code to interpret instructions in _big-endian_ format: 32-bit codeword with
 4-bit opcode and 3-registers identified with 2 bits.

**PPM Image Compressor and Decompressor**
* Wrote a program in C that takes a PPM image and compresses the image by transforming color spaces and discarding information not easily seen by the human eye (this is lossy compression).
* Wrote conversions between different representations of color image data: first a bijection between RGB
and component video (Y/PR/PB) color spaces and then a discrete cosine transform
* Packed and unpacked binary data that puts multiple small values (both signed and unsigned) into a word.
* Implemented two’s-complement representations of signed data alongside floating-point arithmetic.
